        <p style="color: white;">I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more
          so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.</p>
        <p class="j" style="color: white;">“ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking
          to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free
          intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and
          most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a
          Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”</p>

        <p style="color: white;">Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</p>
        <p class="j" style="color: white;">“ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed
          some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll
          by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and
          staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team
          project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could
          ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent experience. It
          certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! ”

        <p class="j" style="color: white;">“ The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really
          refreshing. The program gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself
          as a capable junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need
          from an incredible community of smart and amazing people. ”</p>
